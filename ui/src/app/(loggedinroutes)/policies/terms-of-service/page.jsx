            Arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of
            before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in
            court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different
            rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review
            by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide
            a statement of reasons if requested by either party.

            more than one person&rsquo;s claims or otherwise preside over any form of
            a representative or class proceeding, and the arbitrator
            specifically does not have the power to alter this. The arbitrator
            may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
            seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
            warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim. If a court decides that
            Applicable Law precludes enforcement of any of this Section&rsquo;s
            limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim and
            only that claim must be severed from the arbitration and may be

            The seat and venue of the arbitration is Singapore. The arbitration
            will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the ICC with
            substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As
            modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the
            parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the Rules
            and Procedures. The ICC Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not
            apply.

            participate telephonically. The arbitrator shall make a decision in
            writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by
            either party. The arbitrator must follow Applicable Law, and any
            award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and we
            may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding
            pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment
            on the award entered by the arbitrator.

            Blockchain technologies and cryptographic tokens have been the

            Blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction, and certain

            introduce new regulations addressing Blockchain-based applications.
            These regulations may be contrary to the setup of a Blockchain, its
            smart contract system, or Blockchain Offerings, and therefore may
            result in substantial modifications to such Blockchain and smart
            contract systems, or Blockchain Offerings, including their

          <Text>
            Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the
            development of quantum computing, could present risks to
            cryptocurrencies and Blockchains, Tokens, and Blockchain Offerings

            Smart contracts, blockchain application software, and Blockchain
            protocols are still in an early development stage and relatively

            defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses, or bugs causing,

            Third-party exchanges and marketplaces that support trading in
